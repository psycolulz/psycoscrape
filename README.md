# psycoscrape
Bash Web Applicaton Scanner

How To Use
============================
RUN AS ROOT!!! Updated The Tool To Where It No Longer Requires Users To Edit The Code. I Originally Wanted Users To Learn How To Read And Edit Code While Learning What The Manual Requests Are To Get The Desired Information, But I Have Decided To Aim For Convenience Instead.

What Can It Gather?
============================
PsycoScrape can find header information, WHOIS Info, robots.txt files, crossdomain.xml, XSS Vulnerabilities, and dns information

Will There Be Changes In The Future?
===========================================
Absolutely! I Will Update The Tool Rather Frequently So Make Sure To Update Often!
