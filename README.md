Bash Web Applicaton Scanner

How To Use
============================
RUN AS ROOT!!! Just like All Of My Previous Projects, Users Will Be Forced To Learn How To View And Edit Code While Also Learning The Proper Input For Each Function.
Don't Worry, It Is Pretty Easy To Understand.

What Can It Gather?
============================
PsycoScrape can find header information, robots.txt files, crossdomain.xml, XSS Vulnerabilities, and dns information

Will There Be Changes In The Future?
===========================================
Absolutely! I Will Update The Tool Rather Frequently So Make Sure To Update Often!
